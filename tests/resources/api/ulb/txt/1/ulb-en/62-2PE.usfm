\mt The Second Epistle General of Peter


\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received the same precious faith as we have received, faith in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
\v 2 May grace and peace increase in measure in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

\s5
\v 3 All the things concerning divine power for life and godliness have been given to us through the knowledge of God, who called us through his own glory and virtue.
\v 4 Through these, he gave us precious and great promises, so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, as you escape from the corruption that is in the world because of wicked desires.

\s5
\v 5 For this reason, do your best to add virtue through your faith, and through your virtue, knowledge.
\v 6 Through your knowledge, add self-control, and through your self-control, add endurance, and through your endurance, add godliness.
\v 7 Through your godliness, add brotherly affection, and through your brotherly affection, add love.

\s5
\v 8 If these things are in you and grow in you, you will not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 But whoever lacks these things sees only what is near; he is blind. He has forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.

\s5
\v 10 Therefore, brothers, do your best to make your calling and election sure for yourselves. If you do these things, you will not stumble.
\v 11 In this way an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly granted to you.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things, although you know them, and although you are strong in the truth now.
\v 13 I think it is right for me to stir you up with a reminder about these things, as long as I am in this tent.
\v 14 For I know that soon I will remove my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me.
\v 15 I will do my best for you to always remember these things after my departure.

\s5
\v 16 For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we told you about the power and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. Instead, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice was brought to him by the majestic Glory saying, "This is my Son, the beloved One, with whom I am well pleased."
\v 18 We heard this voice that came out of heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.

\s5
\v 19 We have this prophetic word made more sure. You do well to pay attention to it. It is like a lamp shining in a dark place until the morning comes and the morning star rises in your hearts.
\v 20 Know this first, that no prophecy is about one's own interpretation.
\v 21 For no prophecy ever came by the will of man. Instead, men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 False prophets came to the people, and false teachers will also come to you. They will secretly bring with them destructive heresies, and they will deny the master who bought them. They are bringing quick destruction upon themselves.
\v 2 Many will follow their sensuality, and through them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
\v 3 With greediness they will make a profit off of you with deceptive words. Their condemnation does not delay for long; their destruction does not sleep.

\s5
\v 4 For God did not spare the angels who sinned. Instead he handed them down to Tartarus to be kept in chains of lower darkness until the judgment.
\f + \ft Some other versions read, \fqa to be kept in pits of lower darkness until the judgment. \fqb \f*
\v 5 Also, he did not spare the ancient world. Instead, he preserved Noah, who was a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly.
\v 6 God also reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction, as an example of what is to happen to the ungodly.

\s5
\v 7 But as for the righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the behavior of lawless men in sensuality, God rescued him.
\v 8 For that righteous man, who was living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul because of what he saw and heard.
\v 9 The Lord knows how to rescue godly men out of trials, and how to hold unrighteous men for punishment at the day of judgment.

\s5
\v 10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.
\v 11 Angels have greater strength and power, but they do not bring insulting judgments against them to the Lord.

\s5
\v 12 But these mindless animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.
\v 13 They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing. They think that luxury during the day is a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you.
\f + \ft Other versions read, \fqa They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts. \fqb \f*
\v 14 They have eyes full of adulterous women; they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness. They are children of a curse!

\s5
\v 15 They have abandoned the right way. They went astray and they have followed the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness.
\f + \ft Some other versions read, \fqa Balaam, son of Bosor \fqb \f*
\v 16 But he obtained a rebuke for his own transgression. A mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped the prophet's insanity.

\s5
\v 17 These men are like springs without water. They are like clouds that a storm drives along. Thick darkness is reserved for them.
\v 18 They speak with vain arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error.
\v 19 They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him.

\s5
\v 20 Whoever escapes the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then returns to those defilements again, the last state has become worse for them than the first state.
\v 21 It would have been better for them not to know the way of righteousness than to know it and turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.
\v 22 This proverb is true for them: "A dog returns to its own vomit. A washed pig returns to the mud."

\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now, I am writing to you, beloved, this second letter as a reminder to stir up your sincere mind,
\v 2 so that you will recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command of our Lord and Savior given through your apostles.

\s5
\v 3 Know this first, that mockers will come in the last days. They will mock and proceed according to their own desires.
\v 4 They will say, "Where is the promise of his return? From when our fathers fell asleep, all things have stayed the same, since the beginning of creation."

\s5
\v 5 They willfully forget that the heavens and the earth came to exist out of water and through water, long ago, by God's command,
\v 6 and that through these things, the world of that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
\v 7 But now the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire by that same command. They are reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.

\s5
\p
\v 8 It should not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day.
\v 9 The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider slowness to be. Instead, he is patient toward you. He does not desire for any of you to perish, but for everyone to make room for repentance.

\s5
\v 10 However, the day of the Lord will come as a thief: The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed.
\f + \ft Some versions read, \fqa The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be burned up. \fqb \f*

\s5
\v 11 Since all these things will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should live holy and godly lives.
\v 12 You should expect and hasten the coming of the day of God. On that day, the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great heat.
\v 13 But according to his promise, we are waiting for the new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness will dwell.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Therefore, beloved, since you expect these things, do your best to be found spotless and blameless before him, in peace.
\v 15 Also, consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him.
\v 16 Paul speaks of these things in all his letters, in which there are things that are difficult to understand. Ignorant and unstable men distort these things, as they also do the other scriptures, to their own destruction.

\s5
\v 17 Therefore, beloved, since you know these things, guard yourselves so that you are not led astray by the deceit of lawless people and you lose your own faithfulness.
\v 18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May the glory be to him both now and forever. Amen!
